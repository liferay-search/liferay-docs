# Managing Liferay DXP with Liferay Connected Services

[TOC levels=1-4]

Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set of tools and services for managing and
monitoring your @sharepoint@ instances. LCS can help you install fix packs, monitor
your instances' performance, activate your instances, and help you manage your
subscriptions. In other words, LCS is like a butler for the mansion that is
@sharepoint@. It's like having a single butler that can serve several mansions at once! 

| **Note:** The following LCS features have been deprecated and removed in
| March 2020: Page Analytics, Fix Pack Management, and Portal Properties. Please
| read the 
| [LCS Feature Deprecation Update](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037317691-Liferay-Connected-Services-Feature-Deprecation-Update-March-2020)
| to learn more about how you can prepare for these upcoming changes.
