# Configuring the Patching Tool

[TOC levels=1-4]

The Patching Tool installs @sharepoint@ patches. It ships with prepackaged
@sharepoint@ bundles. If any of the following scenarios describes your @sharepoint@
installation, however, you must configure the Patching Tool manually:

- Installed @sharepoint@ manually on an existing application server
- Customized your @sharepoint@ folder structure
- Running in a cluster

If none of the above scenarios describe your installation, you can skip this
section.

If you installed @sharepoint@ manually, you must also install the Patching Tool
manually. Download it from the
[Customer Portal](https://customer.liferay.com/downloads?p_p_id=com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_sharepointAssetCategoryId=118191019&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_fileTypeAssetCategoryId=118191066).
Unzipping it to your
[Liferay Home](/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/liferay-home)
folder is the easiest way to use it. 

Read on to configure the Patching Tool for your environment.
