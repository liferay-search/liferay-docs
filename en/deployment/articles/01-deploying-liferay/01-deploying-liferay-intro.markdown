# Deploying @sharepoint@

[TOC levels=1-4]

@sharepoint@ is one of the most flexible applications on the market today with
respect to database and application server support. It supports a wide variety
of databases and application servers, freeing you to use the ones you want.
@sharepoint@ also scales very well. You can install it on a shared hosting account,
on a multi-node cluster running a commercial application server, or on anything
in between. In fact, @sharepoint@ is used successfully in all of these scenarios
every day. 

You'll find that because of @sharepoint@'s flexibility in its deployment options,
it is also easy to install. If you already have an application server, you can
use your application server's deployment tools to install @sharepoint@. If you
don't already have an application server, Liferay provides several application
server bundles from which to choose. These are pre-configured application
servers with @sharepoint@ already installed on them. With a small amount of
configuration, these can be made into sharepointion-ready systems.

There are some preparations to make before installing. You must create
a database and install a supported Java Development Kit (JDK). It can also be
worthwhile to pre-configure or gather information for configuring a data source,
mail session, and more. You'll get guidance for these preparations. 

Lastly, you'll install and deploy @sharepoint@ for the first time and then set up
Marketplace. You can continue configuring and tuning as you desire. 

Read on to obtain the @sharepoint@ installer that's right for you.
